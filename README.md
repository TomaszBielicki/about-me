# Business Card Website

## Introduction

Welcome to my business card website! This project is a simple yet personal web page designed to provide essential information about me and my activities. It's an online business card where you can find details about my experience, skills, and ways to get in touch.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to present my professional profile and offer basic information about me as an individual. With this business card website, I aim to achieve several key objectives:

1. **Concise Presentation**: I want to provide visitors with a brief and concise overview of my professional background, education, and skills.

2. **Easy Contact**: I offer contact information, such as email, social media profiles, etc., to make it easy for interested individuals to get in touch with me.

3. **Portfolio**: I showcase selected projects and achievements from my career to demonstrate my skills and accomplishments.

5. **Skill Development**: This project also serves as a platform for learning and enhancing web development skills.

I hope this business card website will help you get to know me better and learn more about my activities. If you have any questions, are interested in collaboration, or just want to chat, I invite you to get in touch!

## Used Technologies

This website was built using the following technologies:

These technologies were chosen for their ability to create dynamic, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing user interfaces. React enables the creation of components and state management, while Styled Components provides a flexible approach to styling components.
